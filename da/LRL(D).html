				<p>Moments later a group of thieves come out of the bushes, a frightened Dean tries to make a run for it. One of the thieves draws his bow and takes aim sending an arrow towards Dean. It pierces Dean in the back causing him to fall over. Screaming in pain on the ground the thieves begin to close in on their prey. This was the last time anyone heard from Dean.
