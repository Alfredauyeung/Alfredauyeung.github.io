					 			<p>I have always had a passion for game development and design, everything about the whole process of how a game comes to life was both perplexing and intriguing. This definitely came from being a gamer most of my life. So to pursue this passion I decided to develop and build a game with a close friend who was in the process of learning Unity, thus Tetra Quest was born.</p>

					 			<p>We decided to put our own spin on Tetris and incorporate a role playing aspect to it. Players will battle against monsters to defeat it as fast as possible. Upon completing 1 - 4 row lines it determines which skills are built up then activated, through color coding the different Tetris pieces. Once the player defeats a basic monster he then goes on to face a boss, upon defeating the boss of each level the player gains experience, gold and a possibility of an item drop. Leveling up will help player acquire new abilities, increase their characters stats and allowing them to use higher level weapons. The application is still far from complete but with the current development we have now we were able to create a MVP. In the near future we will be adding more content to increase the players experience and build on the over-all gamification of the application.</p>
