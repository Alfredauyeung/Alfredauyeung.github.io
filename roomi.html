<!-- Through Startup Institute I was given the oppurtunity to work together with a small team and build a product for Roomi. Roomi is a free web and mobile platform that helps people find affordable co-living solutions through a peer-peer marketplace. Our team was tasked to design and implement a standalone tool which would solve a question shared by many: “Where Should I Live and Who Should I Live With?” We decided to create a quiz which the user answers and with those answers we used an algorithmn to find their perfect roommate within Roomi's listings. Our first steps in this project was research, as there were many neighborhoods in the cities Roomi currently operates in, we had to find facts about these neighborhoods before we began to brainstorm questions for the quiz.  -->
