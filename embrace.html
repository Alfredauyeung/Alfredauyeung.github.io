				 		<p>Out of college and hungry to grow as a designer I began my journey as a freelancer, taking jobs that I knew would help me grow. I was approached by a friend's fraternity brother who was in the process of starting a tutoring company based in New Jersey. Their mission was very simple, to create the best educational experience for their clients by providing them with top-level teachers and mentors that are experienced classroom teachers. Having had many tutors in the past, that I felt were never helpful, their mission really resonated with me.He needed a designer to help create the branding for Embrace Tutoring and I immediately jumped on this opportunity. I was brought on board and created their logo, which went through many changes during the process, as well as their business cards.</p>

			 			<p>After proven success in the initial branding of the company, I was asked to assume all marketing duties and helped design their original website. Over the past couple of years working with Embrace Tutoring I have created flyers, postcards, merchandise and helped with the development of different marketing strategies. The journey with Embrace Tutoring has been one of the best work experiences I have had, even though it got bumpy at times we were able to overcome these bumps and grow together.</p>
